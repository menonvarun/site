##Introduction :

As said earlier **bot-bot** is an native android automation tool. One of the componenets of the **bot-bot** is the **runner**.

Runner is a test exectuion frameowrk based on keyword driven approach. The test cases needs to be defined in “csv” format. These csv files will be converted to java files and then executed using the TestNG framework.
Runner supports 2 types of frameworks **NativeDriver** & **Robotium**. User can choose accordingly from any of the said frameworks.

Runner supports following features:

- Support for test-atuomation for an android application without the need of application source code.
- Execution of the test-case csv file on the said application and generate a test report for it.
- Users can easily add their own implementations to bot-bot and use them as keywords. Bot-bot framework will automatically identify these implementation and execute them accordingly.
- Support for native framework functions are supported out-of-the box.

It uses following open-source tools:

1. [Robotium](http://code.google.com/p/robotium/)
2. [Selenium Nativedriver](http://code.google.com/p/nativedriver/)
3. [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html)

**Note:** In case you need to use Nativedriver as your execution framework , you need to have the source code the app that needs to be tested.

##Download

You can download the latest release recorder from the download section mentioned below:

https://github.com/Imaginea/bot-bot/downloads

---------
##Pre-conditions:

1. Android SDK has been installed. More info is available at [link](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html)
2. Apache ant needs to be installed.[link](http://ant.apache.org/)
3. Install one of the android SDK platform using the Android SDK managers.

---------
##Installation:

###For Robotium:

1. Apk file of the application taht needs to be tested.
2. Open the resources/default.properties file and change the following values:
	- FRAMEWORK -> "robotium"
	- TESTCASE_FOLDER -> test-case folder name under *testcase* where you have your test-cases in csv format.
	- TEST_APK_FILENAME -> Apk file path of the application that needs to be tested.
	- APP_PACKAGE -> The app package name.
	- DEFAULT_ACTIVITY -> Default lanch activity
 	- ANDROID_VERSION -> The version of the android platform that you had downloaded using android sdk. This can be found out by going to the platforms under your **Android SDK** installation directory.
 	- key.store -> path to your keystore file to be used for signing the andorid application. Once you had installed Androdi SDK and configured a simulator this key store file will be automatically generated in your user home directory under *android* fodler.
	- key.store.password -> password of your keystore
	- key.alias -> Alias for you keystore file
	- key.alias.password -> Password of your keystore alias.

	In case you want to use the default keystore file please dont change the above keystore related values in the properties file.
 

	For finding the values of APP_PACKAGE & DEFAULT_ACTIVITY variables install your application on an emulator and start the application. And then watch the adb logs by typing the command *adb logcat*. And look for the following:

{% highlight ruby %}
"Starting activity: Intent { act=android.intent.action.MAIN cat=android.intent.category.LAUNCHER? flg=0x10200000 cmp=com.example.android/.DefaultLauncherActivity"
{% endhighlight %}


From the above APP_PACKAGE will be *com.example.android* and DEFAULT_ACTIVITY will be *DefaultLauncherActivity*.
	
	
3. Set the "ANDROID_HOME" enviornment variable to the Android SDK installation directory on your system ex. "/opt/softwares/android-sdk-linux"
4. Set the tools and platform-tools folder path to your enviornment PATH. ex. "/opt/softwares/android-sdk-linux/tools" & "/opt/softwares/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools"
5. Place your test-case csv files under a folder inside the *testcases* folder in root of the *runner*.
6. From the command-shell go to the the *bot-bot runner* folder and type the follwing command.
{% highlight C %}
ant
{% endhighlight %}

###For NativeDriver:

1. Export the bot-bot from git to your local system.
2. Import the source code of the android app that needs to be installed into your eclipse IDE.
3. Copy the "server-standalone.jar" from the bot-bot/runner/lib folder to the root of the Android project inside Eclipse IDE and add it to build path.
4. Open the AndroidManifest.xml file of your Android app and paste the following to it:

{% highlight ruby %}
< instrumentation android:targetPackage="{app package name}" android:name="com.google.android.testing.nativedriver.server.ServerInstrumentation" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> 
< uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
< uses-permission android:name="android.permission.DISABLE_KEYGUARD" />
{% endhighlight %}

Here the {app package name} needs to be replaced with the name of the package as specified in the mainfest element's package attribute.

5. Build and install the android app on to the simulator.

6. Go to the android sdk installation folder and inside it to platform-tools. Then run the following commands:

{% highlight ruby %}
adb shell am instrument {app_package_name}/com.google.android.testing.nativedriver.server.ServerInstrumentation
{% endhighlight %}

Here {app_package_name} needs to be replaced with the name of the package as specified in the mainfest element's package attribute.
	
{% highlight ruby %}
adb forward tcp:54129 tcp:54129
{% endhighlight %}

You can confirm that the instrumentation is started by running adb logcat and looking for a line like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
I/com.google.android.testing.nativedriver.server.ServerInstrumentation(  273): Jetty started on port 54129
{% endhighlight %}

7. Package name and initial activity name has to be defined in the BaseClass.java file. (This will be converted to properties file going forward)
8. Run the ant command at the root of the andro_auto_framework directory:

{% highlight ruby %}
ant
{% endhighlight %}

This will compile your code and execute your test cases. Currently TestNG , Junit & TestNG-xslt report are generated for the test execution.


-----------
##Data-Driven Tests

Currently Data-driven testing is only supported for Robotium platform & data can be provided only from csv files.

Steps and conventions to be followed for data-driven tests:

1. Data-driven tests should be placed under folder named as 'datadriven'.

2. Data-driven test cases should end with '_datadriven.csv' eg. {testcasename}_datadriven.csv and Data files should end with '_data.csv'  
   eg {testcasename}_data.csv. Note:data file should be named as {testcasename}_data.csv 

3. Values which are to be provided from data.csv at run time should start with $ followed by identifier which would be present in data.csv eg. $title

4. Data files (_data.csv) should have first row as identifiers saperated by commas and other rows as set of data saperated by comma.

5. The first value in the row is considered as testcase name for generation of report, if left blank name of datadriven test case will be considered. Each row is taken as data for a test case.

6. For sample test case with datadriven approach see createNewPost_datadriven.csv and createNewPost_data.csv in datadriven folder present in testcases/wordpress/datadriven
